# Towards Explorative IRBL: Combining Semantic Retrieval with LLM-driven Iterative Code Exploration
This paper proposes GenLoc, a novel IRBL technique that combines semantic retrieval with LLM-driven iterative code exploration to identify buggy files. It operates in two primary steps to localize relevant files. First, it retrieves a set of semantically similar files using an embedding-based similarity approach. Next, it employs an LLM augmented with a set of custom-designed code exploration functions, which enable the model to iteratively reason over the bug report and interact with the code base.
