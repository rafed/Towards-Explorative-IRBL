pylint-dev__pylint-7993,"The bug report indicates that there's an issue with the message template functionality in Pylint when using Python 3.9. Specifically, the user can format messages using custom braces, but a warning is thrown in the newer version when attempting to use a specific message template, indicating that the argument cannot be recognized. This suggests a potential misalignment in expectations versus implementation between different Pylint versions. Key components affected seem to relate to message formatting in Pylint's reporting system, especially within the `pylint/reporters/text.py` file, and also concerning how messages are defined and formatted in `pylint/message/message.py` and `pylint/message/message_definition.py`.

The expected behavior is that both lines containing valid notes (e.g., 'YES: yes') and those with only punctuation (e.g., '???') should produce a fixme warning (W0511).

pylint-dev__pylint-7114,"The bug report describes an issue with Pylint, a Python static code analysis tool, where it fails to run properly if a module with the same name as a subdirectory is present. The crux of the issue arises from Pylint attempting to load the `__init__.py` file for a directory named 'a' while encountering a conflict with the file `a.py` inside that directory. As a result, Pylint cannot parse the module due to the missing `__init__.py` file, leading to a parse error.
