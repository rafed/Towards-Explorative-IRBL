pylint-dev__pylint-7993,"The bug report indicates an issue with using a custom message template in Pylint versions 1.7 and 2.12.2. The user provided a specific message template format, which caused unexpected outputs in the latter version compared to the former. Keywords include 'custom braces', 'message template', and 'verify argument'. The affected components appear to be message formatting and handling within Pylint's reporter classes, specifically involved with outputting messages to the console or files for review.

pylint-dev__pylint-7228,"The bug report indicates an issue related to the use of regex in a configuration file (.pylintrc) for Pylint. The specific error message is thrown when a regex pattern that includes '\p{Han}', which is meant to match Han characters in Unicode, is used as part of the function-rgx configuration. The key error message suggests a bad escape character '\p', which usually arises from incorrect regex syntax during parsing.

Relevant components affected include:
- Regex handling: Particularly in the context of string or character checks, it likely relates to how Pylint is interpreting regex configurations.
- Configuration handling: Functions or classes that manage or parse configuration files, especially those related to regex validations.
- The overall command that invokes Pylint which includes the usage of regex patterns
