sphinx-doc__sphinx-10325,"The bug report details a feature request regarding the handling of inherited members in Python documentation. It highlights the need for the `:inherited-members:` option of `autodoc` to accommodate a list of classes to ignore when documenting inherited members from base classes. Key components involving class inheritance, documentation of members across multiple classes, and specific ignoring of certain base classes (like list, set, or tuple) emerge from the analysis. The report indicates that the current functionality is insufficient for users working with complex class hierarchies and various classes that should not be included in documentation.
