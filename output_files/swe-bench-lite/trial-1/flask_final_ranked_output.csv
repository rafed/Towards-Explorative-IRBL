pallets__flask-5063,"The bug report addresses the functionality of Flask routes, specifically focusing on the inability to see which routes belong to which subdomains. The report mentions specific terms like 'flask routes', 'sub-domains', and blueprints registered with subdomains. Additionally, it suggests that the output of the command `flask routes` should display routes alongside their corresponding subdomains. The report also hints at a feature request for either fixing the existing routes or providing alternative methods to obtain desired information from Flask. Key components to analyze are the blueprints and their relation to routing, especially considering the command that displays registered routes and potentially their subdomains. This indicates that the relevant files would likely include definitions of Flask's routing, blueprint registration, and command-line functionalities.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/flask/app.py"", ""justification"": ""Contains the 'register_blueprint' method that is crucial for understanding how blueprints are associated with routes in Flask.

pallets__flask-4992,"The bug report details the need to enhance the `flask.Config.from_file()` method by adding a file mode parameter. It highlights the issue that arises due to Python 3.11's native TOML support using the `tomllib` package, which requires opening files in binary mode for reading. The error is caused because the method currently opens files in text mode by default, leading to incompatibility when working with TOML files. The key functionalities mentioned include the `from_file()` and `from_mapping()` methods, with TOML file handling being central to the proposed enhancement. Keywords extracted include 'binary mode', 'from_file', and 'TOML'.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/flask/config.py"", ""justification"": ""The `from_file` method is directly implicated in the bug report as it handles file loading for configuration.

pallets__flask-4045,"The bug report indicates a need to raise an error when the blueprint name contains a dot. This is crucial because dots in blueprint names are significant with the introduction of nested blueprints. The report also references similar behavior in endpoint names implemented in version 1.0, indicating that the correct validation for blueprint names has not been established yet. From this, we extract the following keywords: ""blueprint"", ""name"", ""error"", and ""dot"".
