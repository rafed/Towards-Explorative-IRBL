sphinx-doc__sphinx-10325,"The bug report focuses on modifying the behavior of the :inherited-members: directive in Sphinx's autodoc extension, to allow it to accept a list of classes whose inherited members should be ignored. Key components of concern are related to inherited members of multiple base classes and the `automodule` method that facilitates module-level documentation. The suggested improvements aim to simplify and enhance the documentation process when classes inherit from undesired base classes such as list, tuple, etc. Critical keywords include 'inherited-members', 'automodule', 'ignore', 'multiple classes', 'documenting members', and 'base classes'.
