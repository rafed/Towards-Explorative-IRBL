2549,"The bug report details a regression in the `AbstractMapAssert#containsOnlyKeys` method introduced during the transition from AssertJ version 3.19.0 to 3.20.0. The issue arises when this method mutates a `Map` that is being asserted. Specifically, the report highlights that the `MultiValueMapAdapter` class from Spring is utilized, which is characterized by its delegation behavior to an underlying map. Consequently, operations like `Map#remove` affect both the asserted and underlying maps, leading to discrepancies in assertions. Various keys and methods relevant to assertions on maps were identified, particularly the use of `Assert` methods designed to validate key existence without altering the original data structures. The relevant methods indicated in the bug report are tied to `containsOnlyKeys` in `AbstractMapAssert`, along with the adapter behavior in Spring's collection handling.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/main/java/org/assertj/core/api/AbstractMapAssert.java"", ""justification"": ""This file implements the `containsOnlyKeys` method, which is directly implicated in the bug report.

2685,"The bug report indicates that the method `assertContainsIgnoringCase` fails to properly compare characters in a case-insensitive manner for the Turkish locale, specifically noting issues with characters 'i' and 'İ'. The provided code example shows that the method is verifying substring inclusion without taking into account the specific locale nuances when converting characters to lower case.

The keywords and concepts to focus on from the bug report include:
- `assertContainsIgnoringCase`
- Locale-specific comparison (tr_TR)
- Problematic character handling (i and I)
