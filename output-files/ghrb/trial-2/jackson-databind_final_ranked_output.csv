3418,"The bug report indicates an issue with the deserialization of an empty list when the feature `ACCEPT_SINGLE_VALUE_AS_ARRAY` is enabled. Specifically, an empty `List<String>` is incorrectly deserialized to contain a single empty string (`List.of("""")`). The report suggests that the problem originates in the deserialization logic of `StringCollectionDeserializer` and the handling of tokens in `isExpectedStartArrayToken`. Based on the provided test case, it appears that the logic should be modified to handle cases where an empty string is encountered more appropriately, either by adjusting `isExpectedStartArrayToken` or re-working `StringCollectionDeserializer` to attempt coercion for empty string tokens before wrapping them into a list.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/std/StringCollectionDeserializer.java"", ""justification"": ""This file contains the deserializer used for collections of strings.
