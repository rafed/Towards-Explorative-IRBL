20887,"The bug report indicates an issue where generated Python clients from the OpenAPI generator are not properly importing files as expected. Specifically, it mentions a method `reportPrivateImportUsage`, which likely relates to the errors in package imports during code generation. The requirement is for the generated code to correctly output imports in the format `from client.api.my_api import MyApi as MyApi`, rather than the default which does not alias the imported object. The report outlines that the underlying issue lies within the code generation logic that handles package structures and imports.

The bug symptoms indicate that the `toEnumVarName` and related methods are not transforming hyphenated values as expected, resulting in incorrect translations (e.g., a conversion to ‘Minus’ instead of a more suitable format). The issue was previously touched upon in Issue #9683 and PR #16267, emphasizing a need for relevant adjustments to enum naming conventions.
