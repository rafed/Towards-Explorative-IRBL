2685,"The bug report concerns a failure of the `assertContainsIgnoringCase` method to properly compare characters in the `tr_TR` locale, particularly when comparing 'i' and 'I'. The described method is located in the `Strings.java` file of the AssertJ core library. Key terms from the report include 'assertContainsIgnoringCase', 'locale', and 'toLowerCase()', which are relevant in investigating the bug. Since the bug highlights an issue when ignoring case differences, the methods using `toLowerCase()` or related string comparison methods are of particular interest. Additionally, the report references a suggestion to ban unsafe methods such as `toLowerCase()`; thus, files that implement this method might also be critical to review for potential flaws.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/main/java/org/assertj/core/internal/Strings.java"", ""justification"": ""This file contains the implementation of the `assertContainsIgnoringCase` method, which is directly mentioned in the bug report.

2549,"The bug report indicates a regression in the functionality of the `containsOnlyKeys` method within `AbstractMapAssert`, specifically when used in conjunction with `MultiValueMapAdapter` from Spring. The key issues highlighted are that the assertion mutates the underlying map (which it should not), leading to test failures. The example provided shows that two assertions result in differing behavior due to the state change in `underlyingMap` after the first assertion. The source of the problem is linked to the use of `Map#remove` on a clone of the asserted map, which impacts the actual underlying map due to delegation in `MultiValueMapAdapter`. This indicates that methods related to key checking, removal, and assertion within these classes should be closely examined to identify possible flaws in their implementations that might lead to this mutation issue.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/main/java/org/assertj/core/api/AbstractMapAssert.java"", ""justification"": ""Contains the method 'containsOnlyKeys' which is central to the bug report.

2364,"The bug report discusses issues stemming from the transition to Java 17, specifically regarding extracting private values from `Optional` using AssertJ and violation of encapsulation due to changes with the strong encapsulation of JDK internals. Key concepts from the report include the use of `extracting` functionality in AssertJ for accessing fields within an `Optional` object, and the reported `IntrospectionError` which references problems when fields or properties don't match expected names (in this case, 'value').
