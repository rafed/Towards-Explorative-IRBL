544,"The bug report addresses an issue involving the `@JacksonXmlText` and `@JsonRawValue` annotations in the Jackson library. It highlights that when both annotations are applied to a field, the effect of `@JacksonXmlText` is negated in the serialization process. The primary keywords to extract from this report include `@JacksonXmlText`, `@JsonRawValue`, serialization behavior, XML output, and annotations. The conflicting behaviors of the annotations suggest a need to inspect files related to XML serialization, deserialization, and possibly utility classes for handling XML outputs. Specific methods related to handling text-based properties in XML serialization are of particular interest, especially those that could manage the expectations set by these annotations.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/JacksonXmlAnnotationIntrospector.java"", ""justification"": ""Contains the method 'isOutputAsText', which checks if the property should be serialized as text.
