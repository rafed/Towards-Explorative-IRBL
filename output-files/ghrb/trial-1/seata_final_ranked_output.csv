4056,"The bug report suggests that the code in the `DurationUtil` class can be optimized, specifically focusing on supporting the `ISO-8601` format like `P1DT1M`, refining return values during parsing, and general code optimizations. The report implies that the existing parsing methods might not be handling all expected formats accurately or efficiently. The relevant methods `parse(String str)` and `doParse(String unit, String str)` serve as critical points for analysis and possible improvements. Unit tests are also present, which provide insights into the current functionality and expectations around error handling. Keywords for further inquiry include 'optimize', 'ISO-8601', and 'unified return value'.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""common/src/main/java/io/seata/common/util/DurationUtil.java"", ""justification"": ""Contains primary methods relevant to the optimization task (`parse` and `doParse`).

5120,"The bug report discusses a problem with parameters not being uniform, specifying that some parameters are surrounded by double quotes while others are not. This likely pertains to the way parameters are parsed and managed in the application.
