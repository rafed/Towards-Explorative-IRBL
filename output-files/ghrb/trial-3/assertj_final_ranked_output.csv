2549,"The bug report summarizes a regression in `AbstractMapAssert#containsOnlyKeys` triggered by the transition from AssertJ version 3.19.0 to 3.20.0. The core issue is that the assertion method appears to mutate the map it's validating, specifically when asserting an instance of `org.springframework.util.MultiValueMapAdapter` which delegates operations to an underlying map. This unintended side effect results in failures in unit tests due to the original `underlyingMap` being manipulated, leading to assertions failing on a subsequently empty map after the first assert call. Key components for investigation include `AbstractMapAssert` where the `containsOnlyKeys` method is implemented and references to the `MultiValueMapAdapter`. The specific pull request that introduced the bug is also relevant, especially its handling of maps within assertion methods, notably using `Map#remove`.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/main/java/org/assertj/core/api/AbstractMapAssert.java"", ""justification"": ""Contains the main assertion methods including `containsOnlyKeys`, critical for this bug as it has been identified as the source of mutation, leading to unwanted side effects.""}, {""file"": ""src/main/java/org/assertj/core/internal/Maps.java"", ""justification"": ""Includes utility methods for assertions on maps, specifically the handling of keys in `assertContainsOnlyKeys`, which is directly related to the bug's context.""}, {""file"": ""src/test/java/org/assertj/core/api/map/MapAssert_containsOnlyKeys_Test.java"", ""justification"": ""Contains test cases that directly test `containsOnlyKeys`, essential for reproducing the bug and examining the assertion behavior.""}, {""file"": ""src/test/java/org/assertj/core/internal/maps/Maps_assertContainsOnlyKeys_Test.java"", ""justification"": ""Tests the `assertContainsOnlyKeys` method in the context of map assertions, which is vital to understanding how the underlying operations work.""}, {""file"": ""src/test/java/org/assertj/core/api/map/MapAssert_containsKeys_Test.java"", ""justification"": ""Tests methods related to key assertions, which may intersect with `containsOnlyKeys` functionality.""}, {""file"": ""src/test/java/org/assertj/core/api/map/MapAssert_containsOnly_with_Java_Util_MapEntry_Test.java"", ""justification"": ""Investigates assertions involving multiple keys, relevant to the way `containsOnlyKeys` operates.""}, {""file"": ""src/test/java/org/assertj/core/api/map/MapAssert_containsExactly_Test.java"", ""justification"": ""Test coverage for assertions that could reveal behavior changes in key handling after the regression.""}, {""file"": ""src/test/java/org/assertj/core/api/map/MapAssert_extractingByKeys_Test.java"", ""justification"": ""Enhances understanding of how keys are processed, showing indirect effects related to the bug.""}, {""file"": ""src/test/java/org/assertj/core/internal/maps/Maps_assertContains_Test.java"", ""justification"": ""May provide insights into how map assertions work overall and highlight interactions with the faulty methods.""}]}",src/main/java/org/assertj/core/internal/Maps.java
2445,"The bug report indicates that the method `isExactlyInstanceOf` returns a confusing error message when checking an instance of an anonymous inner class. The primary issues appear to be related to error message clarity, particularly when the actual object being checked is not of the expected type but is not null.

The affected components include the classes where the `isExactlyInstanceOf` method is defined and any error message classes that handle assertions made with this method.

2685,"The bug report highlights an issue with the method `assertContainsIgnoringCase` in the `Strings` class, particularly in relation to how it compares characters in a specified locale (tr_TR). The key points in the report include a failure to recognize character case differences, specifically between 'i' and 'I', which points toward potential issues in the implementation's handling of locale-specific case insensitivity. Furthermore, the report suggests a verification mechanism to prevent unsafe method calls (like `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()`) that could compromise the expected behavior in certain locales. The method `assertContainsIgnoringCase` uses `toLowerCase()` directly, which is likely contributing to the reported bug. The class `Strings` and its related test classes are of central relevance in this context, as they appear to contain functionality critical to the bug's symptomology. Furthermore, suggested tests related to case-insensitive comparisons reinforce the need to examine equality checks and their conditions in the implementation and test cases.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/main/java/org/assertj/core/internal/Strings.java"", ""justification"": ""Directly contains the method `assertContainsIgnoringCase`, which is identified in the bug report.
