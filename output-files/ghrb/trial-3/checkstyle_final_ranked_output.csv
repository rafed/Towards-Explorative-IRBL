16252,"The bug report indicates an issue with the behavior of the cyclomatic complexity check related to the 'switchBlockAsSingleDecisionPoint' functionality in Checkstyle, specifically for a case with 'when' expressions. The bug effectively points out that the complexity count is incorrect when 'when' literals are used. Given the example code (Test.java) provided in the bug description, it emphasizes that even with 'switchBlockAsSingleDecisionPoint' set to true, certain expressions are incorrectly counted towards the cyclomatic complexity, leading to a violation.

16458,"The bug report indicates a need to update the grammar for `{@link}` and `{@linkplain}` tags to allow empty references. This is a significant requirement as failing to account for empty tags would lead to parsing errors during Checkstyle audits. The specific error mentioned in the report arises from the `Checkstyle` configuration indicating issues with how Javadoc comments are parsed when expected content is missing. From the context, it appears that the `NonEmptyAtclauseDescription` module currently throws errors when it encounters Javadoc tags without a reference. This highlights a need for updates in the Javadoc parsing rules located in the grammar files. The bug appears closely related to file handling, parsing, and comment checks within Java code.
