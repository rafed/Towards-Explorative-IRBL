pylint-dev__pylint-7993,"The bug report indicates an issue with using custom braces in a message template while executing Pylint on Python 3.9 compared to how it functioned on Python 3.6. The provided command `pylint test.py --msg-template='{{ ""Category"": ""{category}"" }}'` causes a warning about unrecognized arguments, implying a potential problem with how templates are parsed or used in the updated Pylint version. The critical aspect lies in understanding how the message formatting and templating mechanism has changed between Pylint versions.
