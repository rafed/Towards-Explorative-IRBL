155238,"**Keywords & Issues Identified:**  The bug report summary emphasizes the preference for `System.identityHashCode` over the traditional method `hashCode()`. According to the description, the tracing module currently employs `obj.hashCode()`, which could lead to unreliable results if the application's state changes, as application-defined `hashCode` methods can allow different outputs based on internal logic or state. Thus, the tracing functionality needs to adopt a method yielding results that are unaffected by such factors. The report specifically highlights areas where tracing occurs (likely within class methods related to `Trace`, `DefaultTrace`, etc.) and indicates a need for better safety when formatting untrusted object information.

**Functional Hints & Affected Components:**  - Tracing - safety (obj.hashCode vs System.identityHashCode) - Formatting of objects within a logging or tracing context, potentially indicating methods in the `Trace` classes.
