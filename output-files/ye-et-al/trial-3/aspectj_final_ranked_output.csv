419279,"The bug report is concerning the configuration of warning levels related to the AspectJ compiler's -Xlint options. The user highlights that the existing -Xlintfile option does not provide a flexible way to manage these settings across multiple projects, especially through the 'pluginManagement' section of a Maven parent POM. The proposed alternative is to allow command line arguments to set lint warning levels on a per-messaging basis, which will offer more control to developers. Keywords from the report include 'ajc', 'Xlint', 'warning level', 'command line options', and references to management at a global or project level.
